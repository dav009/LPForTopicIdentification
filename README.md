Abstract:
Microblogging has become a trend,thus many users
are using such platforms to share their opin-
ions.Mining these opinions can reveal valuable in-
formation to companies, such as what features
to develop in their products or marketing strate-
gies.However there are major drawbacks when min-
ing tweets, first their length do not provide enough
word occurrences so traditional bag-of-words meth-
ods have limitations, second they are extremely
noisy and third annotated data is limited and costly
to get.
In this paper we address the problem of classify-
ing short product reviews by using semisupervised
learning. A comparison among two semisupervised
methods and a supervised method is given. Finally
we propose different ways to improve the given re-
sults by injecting knowledge into the semisuper-
vised mode
